## Introduction
This programm guesses a binary string that the user inputs using evolutionary computation
methods


## Motivation
This project was developed as part of a Programming Course.I am using it exercise programming various genetic programming techniques.I would be glad if you contributed .

## Installation

While on main folder run :

	$make 
	$make clean
## Execution 

On the main folder run :

	$./guessga
## Return Values 
1 Evolution ended after reaching the max generations 
2 Evolution ended after reaching the Fittest threshold 

## Genetic Operators 
Currently tournament selction ,roulette wheel selection ,mutation ,single point crossover .The paramaters for the genetic operators are defined in the source code .
